KnpMenu
=======

The KnpMenu library provides object oriented menus for PHP.
It is used by the [KnpMenuBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpMenuBundle) for Symfony
but can now be used stand-alone.

This fork has the aim to fix deprecation since Twig 3.12 for our project

## Credits

This bundle was originally ported from [ioMenuPlugin](http://github.com/weaverryan/ioMenuPlugin),
a menu plugin for symfony1. It has since been developed by [KnpLabs](http://www.knplabs.com) and
the [Symfony community](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpMenu/graphs/contributors).
